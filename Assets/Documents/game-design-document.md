# Game Design Document

## Project Concept
### 1. Player Control
You control the architect in this side view game where arrow keys and mouse makes the player moves around the screen in all directions
### 2. Basic Gameplay
During the game, the architect can build facilities on the screen and the goal of the game is to build a working moon station
### 3. Sound and Effects
There will be sounds effects when the architect build/destroy facilities and station lifecycle generates sounds.
Particle effects will be displayed when build/destroy or lifecycle event happens.
There will be a scrolling background
### 4. Gameplay Mechanics
As the game progresses, the architect should build new facilities which needs more resources, making the game harder and more complex.
There will be achievements for the Moon station states.
### 5. User Interface
The resources will decrease whenever the architect build something.
The buildings will be unlocked whenever a the requirements are met.
The resources will increase whenever a facility finishes production.
At the start of the game, the title Moonshot will appear and the game will never end.
### 6. Other Features
Tutorial for the first few steps.
Start Menu with selecting a moon station name.
Minimal animation before the tutorial.
